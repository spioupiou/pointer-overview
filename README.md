**Title:** A Very Beginner's Guide to Pointers

**Introduction:**

When I first started learning about pointers, I struggled to find clear, easy-to-understand explanations That's why I decided to put together this brief and straightforward overview. 
While I'm using Go for examples, the basics of pointers apply across various programming languages. By understanding the following concepts, you'll make significant progress in your understanding of pointers!

**Reassigning a Variable:**
Let's start by creating a string variable called `myName`:

```go
package main

func main() {
  myName := "Laura"
}
```

Now we want to reassign `myName` while keeping our code clean. We can achieve this by creating a function called `rename()` that takes a string as a parameter and updates it. 

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func rename(x string) string {
  x = "NewLaura"
  return x
}

func main() {
  myName := "Laura"
  rename(myName)
}
```
You might expect `myName` to change, but it remains "Laura." Why? When we call `rename()`, a copy of `myName` is created and the changes are applied only to that copy, leaving the original value of `myName` unchanged. Try printing `x` and `myName` to check their values.

**Using a New Variable:**

One way to address this is by storing the return value of `rename()` in a new variable:

```go
newName := rename(myName)
```
However, this method is not that inefficient as we are still producing copies of the `myName` variable, consuming unnecessary memory.

**The Pointer Solution:**
How can we pass the actual variable `myName` to the function, without creating unnecessary copies? This is where pointers come in handy! Before we dive in, remember these three key points:
- A pointer is simply an address. It stores the memory address of another variable. 
- To generate a pointer, use the `&` operator as shown below:

```go
name := "Laura"
pName := &name // pName stores the memory address of the variable `name`
```
- Use the `*` operator to access the pointer's underlying value:
```go
fmt.Println(pName)  // This prints the memory address, e.g., "0xc000014070"
fmt.Println(*pName) // This prints "Laura"
```

**Putting Pointers into Action:**

Now, let's use our previous code but tweak the `rename()` function so that it accepts a pointer as a parameter:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func rename(pX *string) *string {
  *pX = "NewName" // Here, we change the underlying value of pX
  return px
}

func main() {
  myName := “Laura”
  rename(&myName) // Passing the address of the variable myName to the rename() function
}
```

What do you expect myName to be now? You've got it right, it will be “NewLaura”!
